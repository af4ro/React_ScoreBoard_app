# React_ScoreBoard_app

ScoreBoard is a simple React based web-app that keeps track of players' scores. It has additional features like a Stopwatch, a Total Count and the ability to add and delete players. This is a simple project that was made by me while doing a TreeHouse course named "React Basics"
